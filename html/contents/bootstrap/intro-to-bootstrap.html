                        <li><b>What is Bootstrap?</b></li>
                        <p>Bootstrap is a free, open-source and is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating responsive web applications.</p>
                        <p>It consists of HTML and CSS based design templates for common user interface components like Buttons, Dropdowns, Typography, Tabs, Forms, Tables, Navigations, Alerts, Modals, Accordion, Carousel etc. along with optional JavaScript extensions.</p>
                        <p>Bootstrap framework is based on open standards - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This means bootstrap can be used with any server side technology and any platform. You can use it with any web application built with any server side technology like ASP.NET, JAVA, PHP etc.</p>

                        <li><b>Bootstrap History</b></li>
                        <p>Bootstrap was originally named Twitter Blueprint and was initially developed by former Twitter employees Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Then, in August 2011, Bootstrap was released as an open source project on Github and remaining as the most popular and most capable repository across many platforms.</p>

                        <li><b>Why use Bootstrap?</b></li>
                        <p><u>Responsive Design:</u> One of the greatest advantages of using bootstrap is that it helps us create responsive web applications faster and easier.  A responsive web application automatically adapts to different screen sizes (desktop computers, laptops, tablets. mobile phones etc.) A responsive application provides optimal viewing and interaction experience i.e easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a wide range of devices so that you don't have to worry about your application not being compatible with multiple devices. </p>
                        <p><u>Time-saving:</u> Bootstrap saves us a lot of development time. Instead of writing code from the scratch, bootstrap offers ready made blocks of code that you can use and customize to suit your application requirements. There are also many websites out there that offer free and paid Bootstrap themes that saves even more development time.</p>
                        <p><u>Consistency:</u> Bootstrap was developed by Twitter to encourage consistency across the internal tools by giving their developers a centralised development code. Since all the developers are working using a centralised code, the end result is consistent regardless of whoâ€™s working on the project and which web browser is being used.</p>
                        <p><u>Customizable:</u> If you are using only a few features of bootstrap, you can customize to download only those features using the following bootstrap customize page.
                            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/">http://getbootstrap.com/customize/</a>
                        </p>
                        <p><u>Support:</u> As Bootstrap is the most popular framework, it has a very large community base and excellent documentation. Bootstrap's excellent documentation, examples and demos helps a developer learn bootstrap quickly even if you are new to it. If you ever run into an issue you will usually get help quickly and easily from the vast online community and web forums.</p>
