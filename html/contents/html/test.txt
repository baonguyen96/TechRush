        <h3>Headings and Paragraphs</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>In this section, we'll be covering how to add the main text to a webpage you're working on.
            Some of the basic HTML elements used in a document involve "headings" and "paragraphs".</p>
        <h4>Headings</h4>
        <p>Headings are used to properly identify each section of text or media located on a web page.
            Currently 6 different headings can be used on a web page with varying text sizes depending on the type of
            heading applied to it. Starting with the biggest and most important heading, &lt;h1&gt;, and going to the smallest and
            least important, &lt;h6&gt;, with the various sizes in between (&lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, & &lt;h5&gt;)
            <br>
            It should be noted that while it may be possible to use different heading styles for text decoration,
            avoidance of this habit is important to ensure proper HTML syntax</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of headings</p>

        <h1>This is an "h1" heading</h1>
        <h2>This is an "h2" heading</h2>
        <h3>This is an "h3" heading</h3>
        <h4>This is an "h4" heading</h4>
        <h5>This is an "h5" heading</h5>
        <h6>This is an "h6" heading</h6>
        <br>
        <p>Headings are great to use for web page organization as well as content navigation. The structure of your content is
            essentially set up by your headings and helps search engines identify the different parts of your content</p>

        <h4>Paragraphs </h4>
        <p>Using the &lt;p&gt; tag we can define different <bold>paragraphs</bold> in the content you have set up on your web page.
            <br> One thing to note about the content you put inside of the paragraph tags, is that it will not be affected
            by carriage returns or tab inputs. To add carriage returns to text-based content one can utilize the &lt;br&gt; tag.</p>
        <p>Another work around is by using the &lt;pre&gt; tags. Using a &lt;pre&gt; tag will help with sustaining any space and/or line breaks in the html code</p>
        <p>For Example this:</p>
        <pre>
                    &lt;pre&gt;
                        This is line 1

                        This is line 2

                        This is line 3
                    &lt;pre&gt;
                </pre>

        <p>Will Output this:</p>
        <pre>
                    This is line 1

                    This is line 2

                    This is line 3
                </pre>
        <br>
        <br>
