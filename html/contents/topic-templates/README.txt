DO NOT MODIFY THE HTML TEMPLATE FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY BECAUSE IT IS USED BY EVERYONE.
JUST CREATE A COPY OF THE TEMPLATE AND MOVE IT TO YOUR TOPIC DIRECTORY THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON,
THEN YOU CAN CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE COPIED FILE.
YOU ALSO SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE PAGE SINCE IT IS ALREADY STYLED IN CSS.
